    "## Dataset Choice and Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "I have chosen the NYC Food Scrap Drop-off Sites dataset for this custom chatbot project. \n",
    "This dataset contains information about food scrap collection locations throughout New York City, \n",
    "including addresses, operating hours, accepted materials, and special instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is highly appropriate for a custom chatbot because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The data contains detailed, location-specific information that \n",
    "   a general AI model would not have access to, making the custom data essential for accurate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. NYC residents genuinely need this information to participate in food scrap \n",
    "   recycling programs, making this a real-world useful application.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Each drop-off site has unique characteristics (hours, materials accepted, \n",
    "   special instructions) that require the model to understand and synthesize multiple data points \n",
    "   to provide helpful answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Without this custom data, the model cannot provide specific \n",
    "   locations, hours, or guidelines for food scrap drop-off in NYC, making the before/after \n",
    "   comparison very apparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chatbot would be valuable for NYC residents, community organizations, and environmental \n",
    "initiatives seeking to increase participation in food scrap recycling programs."
