# NYC Food Scrap Drop-off Assistant Chatbot
A custom OpenAI-powered chatbot that provides specific information about food scrap recycling locations throughout New York City. This project demonstrates how to build a specialized AI assistant using custom datasets and embedding-based retrieval.
## üéØ Project Overview
This chatbot solves a real-world problem by helping NYC residents find convenient food scrap drop-off locations in their neighborhoods. Unlike generic AI assistants, this bot provides specific addresses, operating hours, and requirements for participating in NYC's food scrap recycling program.

## Key Features

* Location-Specific Information: Provides exact addresses and neighborhoods for drop-off sites
* Schedule-Aware: Shows operating hours and days for each location
* Borough-Specific Search: Filter results by Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, or Staten Island
* Smart Recommendations: Uses semantic search to find the most relevant sites for user queries
* Before/After Comparison: Demonstrates clear improvement over baseline AI responses

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The chatbot uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach:

* Data Preparation: NYC food scrap site data is processed into searchable text descriptions
* Embedding Creation: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small converts text into vector representations
* Similarity Search: User queries are matched against site embeddings using cosine similarity
* Context-Aware Response: Relevant site information is used as context for GPT-4o responses
